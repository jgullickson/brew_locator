## Brew Locator

Integrates TomTom maps SDK with OpenBreweryDB API to deliver an interactive map of nearby breweries.

### Note:
Current implementation allows user to select state (e.g. 'Minnesota') and display breweries in that state.
Future feature: allow user to filter breweries by radius of current gps location.
